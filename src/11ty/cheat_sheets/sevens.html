        <p>Blood Bowl Sevens teams can purchase Inducements during Step 4 of the pre-game sequence just
            like a regular Blood Bowl team, and are awarded Petty Cash in the same way. However, due to
            the amateur nature of the competition, the list of Inducements available is somewhat shorter
            and some costs are slightly different:</p>

        <h2 id="injury-table">APOTHECARIES (SEVENS)</h2>
        <p>During a Blood Bowl Sevens game, a team may use an apothecary to 'patch-up' any player
            (including Journeymen and Mercenaries) that has been removed from play after being Knocked
            Out or after suffering a Badly Hurt, Seriously Hurt or DEAD result on the Injury table.</p>
        <h4 id="patching-up-knocked-out-players">PATCHING-UP KNOCKED-OUT PLAYERS</h4>
        <p>An apothecary can be used immediately when a player becomes Knocked-out:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the player was on the pitch when they were Knocked-out, they are not removed from
                play. Instead, they remain on the pitch and become Stunned.</li>
            <li>If the player was Knocked-out as a result of being pushed back into the crowd or landing
                in the crowd, place them directly into the Reserves box rather than the Knocked-out box.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="patching-up-casualties">PATCHING-UP CASUALTIES</h4>
        <p>An apothecary can be used when a player suffers a Badly Hurt, Seriously Hurt or DEAD result
            on the Injury table. Roll a D6:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>On a roll of 4+, the apothecary has been able to patch the player up and pump them full
                of painkillers. The player is removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves
                box.</li>
            <li>On a roll of 1-3, the apothecary's vigorous efforts prove largely futile. The apothecary
                is unable to patch the player up the original Injury table result stands.</li>
