        <h2 id="risking-injury">RISKING INJURY</h2>
        <p>
            Whenever one player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, they become Prone and risk injury. When a
            player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, the coach of the opposing team will make an Armour
            roll against that player.
            Note that when a player is Placed Prone, perhaps having wrestled an opponent to the ground,
            there is no risk of injury and no Armour roll is made against them.
        </p>
        <h3>ROLLING FOR INJURY</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>ARMOUR ROLL</strong>
                Roll 2D6 to see if the Armour breaks. If so, do an Injury Roll.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>INJURY ROLL</strong>
                Roll 2D6 to see if an Injury has been caused. If so, do a Casualty Roll.

            <li>
                <strong>CASUALTY ROLL</strong>
                Roll 1D16 on the casualty-table to determin the kind of casualty.

        <p>
            When a player is pushed back into the crowd or lands in the crowd, they risk Injury by the
            Crowd. No Armour roll is made against the player. Instead the coach of the opposing team
            rolls immediately on the Injury table to see what the crowd does to the player:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If the player is Stunned, they are placed in the Reserves box.</li>
            <li>
                If the player is Knocked-out, they are placed in the Knocked-out box. They may recover
                as usual at the end of the drive.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the player becomes a Casualty, they are placed in the Casualty box. A roll is made
                against them on the Casualty table, as described below.
